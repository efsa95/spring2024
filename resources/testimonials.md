# Testimonials from Spring 2024 Students

The best way to be sucessful in this course is to be on top of your work. I know that sounds obvious and you should apply it to every class but for this class especially it matters a lot because what I struggled with was not really realizing I had work to do because it never felt like I did and I was so preoccupied with my other couses that I started feeling more and more behind. 
Also this class in my opinion is a class thats more important than any calculus class you will take because you actually need to understand how to use github since it is so prevalent in companies today. 

# Testimonials from Fall 2024 Students
I came into this class with little to no knowledge of Terminal or git, now I'm confidently using these tools with a great understanding of how they and other tools work. 
I genuinely use these tools/skills for my own projects and now have the means to overcome problems I encounter due to my over all understanding of computer science and its endless world of documentation.   It's hard to quantify just how much this will impact my career, but rarely have I taken a class where I've been able to directly apply the knowledge I'm gaining to things I'm currently doing. I highly recommend taking this class alongside CSC212 and trying to absorb as much knowledge as possible. 
My general advice is to not worry too much about the semi confusing badge system and just focus on the material for personal gain. This class may seem overwhelming because itâ€™s all very new, but the grading is actually very fair and you have so much to gain from it.
